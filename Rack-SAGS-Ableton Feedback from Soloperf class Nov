Rack-SAGS-Ableton Feedback from Soloperf class Nov 6

Jason enjoyed the parts when the silence 

there was an effect where the light from the outside was reflecting on the tree leaves, and these changing patterns were being 'drawn' on the wall opposite the windows. just so happened that since i turned the lights off and asked them to do an embodied listening, they found the tree patterns changing beautifully with the music, apparently was trippy. 

- what is driving your content?
	- wanted it to be more rhythmic-focused

- what do you want the experience of the audience to be?
	- 

- what landscape do you want us to travel through


sometimes your transitions were 
	- how do you breathe into the next transitions? 
	- huge problem: so i gave the audience some time and space to settle into a breathing rhythm before the start of the piece BUT I'M NOT DOING IT FOR MYSELF. I think the next performance, you need to request 5 minutes (OR MORE -- try a few deep listening exercises?)
