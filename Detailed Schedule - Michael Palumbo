I have an improvisation-based sound performance piece that I have performed in a few different contexts: a treated electroacoustic theatre, a dive bar, the Buddies in Bad Times cabaret stage, to name a few. My primary goal in workhopping this piece through this class is to be able to effectively and efficiently describe the piece to the audience before the performance, and also shape the piece in such a way that it the audience understand what is happening, perhaps through additional visual elements. 

Detailed Schedule - Michael Palumbo

Fridays from 6pm-11pm 
I teach on Fridays up at York, and thus far I've found that what I most look forward to doing when I get home is coding some art, so this will be my main block of time for development. I have 11pm as the end of this period of time, but in reality I rarely stop coding until 1 or 2 in the morning on Fridays. 

Mondays from 4:30-5:30pm
Since my work involves tech, I always reserve some time before a performance to test my system(s), ideally in the venue concerned.
