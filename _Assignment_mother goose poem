mother goose poem

- I asked him what it was like to be carried out by me as one of his pallbearers.
	- he said that he tried to make himself lighter for me. 

I asked him if he remembers shooting me in the face with a foam nerf bow and arrow.

he told me that if i didn't go to visit my nonna soon enough he'd shoot me with that arrow again.
