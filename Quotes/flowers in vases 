"So let's talk about flowers. If we put some flowers in a vase, we do so in order to show how beautiful they are, in order to enjoy them. We can also make them take in ultrerior meanings: filial or religious piety, love, recognition, respect. But so beautiful as they might be, flowers have a defect, taken out of their own context, they continue to represent only themselves. They are like the actor of when Decroux speakes:  man condemned to resmemble just a a man, a body imitating a body. This may well be pleasing, but to be considered art it is not sufficient to merely be pleasing. In order for there to be art, add Decroux, the idea of the thing needs to be represented by anothe thing. Flowers in a vase are irremidiably flowers in a vase, sometimes objects of art, but never works of art themselves. 
But let's imagine using our flowers to represent something else: the struggle of the plant to grow, to move away from the earth into which its roots sink ever deeper as it strives upwards to the sky. Let's imagine wanting to represent the passage of time, ass the plant blossoms, grows, develops and dies. If we succeed with an intention, the flower will represent something other than flowers and will constitute a work of art." (Eugenio Barba. Theatre Anthropology(?))
