You don't have to perform the same piece each week. Erika encourages you to throw shit to the wall. 

fearless creating is a really scary book, super recommended by erika. 

erika: intention is a big part of being an artist. intention is key. 

erika's questionnaire

categories of questions:



be as honest as you can be in response to erika's questions

why does your artist/creator/director want to create a solo show? why the hell would you put yourself through this?

i am so stuck on this loop of beating the crap out of myself for having unfinished work, for having started/stopped so many projects

ALSO I like the research-creation cycle


what do you expect to get? what do you think you will get? what do you want? 
this piece has already been performed a few times, so i want to be better at describing it (introducing it, i.e. the script). i want to let the piece grow instead of just performing it within the parameters that currently exist for it. 



why does your performer-self want to do this

i do love performing, and i don't set up enough opportunities as much as i would like. 

my research-creation practice needs more improvisation, more sound art/digital media art. 


why does your heart / soul / mind / body want to do this? 

i took this course 2 years ago, and had a really difficult time with it. i fought many of the assignments and exercises the whole way through. in the end, i felt as though i wasted my time, and then carried a heavy guilt of having shared a deep/dark secret without having found a way to express it. -- not only not having found a way to express it but also choosing to avoid having to express it. i treated the class as a therapy session, but didn't commit to the exercises. 


why does your business/scholarly want to create a solo show and what do you hope to gain?

i want to be considered by my peers and community(s) as a good performance artist. 

ALSO: research-creation is business-scholarly + creativity/performance
- ERIKA STIPULATES THAT BY BUSINESS SHE MEANS HOW YOU WILL MAKE MONEY AND HOW YOU WILL GET AUDIENCE. 


Prioritize in all of these above areas what is most important 1-10

1. the confidence to push myself through the ENTIRE process of making. 

2. i want to be considered as a relevant artist

3. i want to be thirsty for being busy as a performer

4. 


Erika says that creation and business can go hand in hand in the most beautiful way. I you are truly passionate about something, that means that people want to get involved in it: you will have an audience, you will have funders, etc. the passion that you have will drive your connection to your community. organized in a way that has passion and meaning

personal deadline for this class:


write to erika what you want by the end of the class:
	i want an 8-10 minute improvisatory sound piece that I can perform in many different contexts. the big thing i want to have after this class is to be able to effectively and efficiently describe the piece to the audience before the performance <<OR>> shape the piece in such a way that it the audience understand what is happening (or, likely, a hybrid of each)
