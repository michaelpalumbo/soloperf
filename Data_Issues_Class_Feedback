Data_Issues_Class_Feedback

Who are you talking to?
why do we care?

Making things easier for yourself in the risk taking is totally ok. if you're going to take a risk, do what ever you need to take that risk. i.e. 

research, if you're going to do something new, do some research. who has done this before and what can i steal from them. abby hoffman's book "steal this book"

how much of the point of view do you want control over?
	- thats a great question! i think data issues is the first piece of mine (at least in a very long time) where I'm VERY intent on having the audience know my POV. 

i chose a random activity:
	- how often 
	- sometimes we take a risk and we think its something we haven't done before. 
	- what would happen if you take your work and didn't make it be random > 
		- where is orchestration where is structure? 
			- me: what i take from this is that even though there was quite a lot of structure, the randomness aspect (which in this case was the cards, and the random mapping assignments), what erika zeroed in on was that it was random. now, in the past, she has perceived works of mine as being random (but they weren't, its just that the structure was at such a fine degree of detail [microtemporal], that those unfamiliar to electroacoustic music tend to perceive it as random.)
				- what i want feedback on is not the random parts, but the structure. what was not clear about this structure?
