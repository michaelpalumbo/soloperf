Who are you talking to?
why do we care?

Making things easier for yourself in the risk taking is totally ok. if you're going to take a risk, do what ever you need to take that risk. i.e. 

research, if you're going to do something new, do some research. who has done this before and what can i steal from them. abby hoffman's book "steal this book"

how much of the point of view do you want control over?
	- thats a great question! i think data issues is the first piece of mine (at least in a very long time) where I'm VERY intent on having the audience know my POV.
