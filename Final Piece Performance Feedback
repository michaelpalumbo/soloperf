Final Piece Performance Feedback

-- affords being in dialog with your work. 
-- This idea that good code tells you what it itself does, good documentation tells you why the programmer made it like that. (we are limited in our ability to construct theories of other people's minds)
	-- to this end, I document not only because i assume someone else in the future will encounter my work, and i want them to have scaffolding, but also I expect that I might encounter my own work in the future and also require such scaffolding. 

-- mention programming VR in VR: developing a version control system for this context. 



My feedback to classmates:
	Mark:
	so erika was saying to mark that it moves too fast to keep up. I actually found that the chaos, or ilinx created by the pacing of the piece worked for me, where PTSD can manifest uncontrollable flashbacks. 
	- desiree mentioned it wasn't clear what the rules were. there was that moment when you mentioned i (michael) could correct you on the validity of your statement about the Juno-6 synthesizer. 
		- "symbols signals and noise" by John Pierce - Around page 81 it gets into entropy and redundancy (but earlier pages help rout out other less-useful/innacurate definitions of entropy). See also how entropy can create redundancy. (so modulating entropy and redundancy could be useful in thinking about pacing and information load)
		- Regarding understanding rules, or communicating the rules to an audience (but also the philosophical): Bernard Suits' "Grasshopper: Games, Life, and Utopia"
		- Jane McGonigal's research on Tetris and PTSD, particularly since tetris has a narrative arc that is about increasing frenetic pacing (can therefore potentially relate to his/erika's concern with pacing; but also the science of how playing tetris after a traumatic experience reduces likelihood of flashbacks)

	Corey:
	There was this moment, my absolute favourite moment tonight: before you started there was some kind of faint music emanating from the conduit over by the tech corner. so faint, but still audible. Then, just a beat before you spoke for the first time near the end, the music stopped. I personally am a big fan of when performances condition a room/audience, then at some point the TAKE IT AWAY. Subtraction can be really effective for intensity in this way.  

	Amanda:
	I wanted you to swear more than 'fuck'. like after a while 'fuck' was not interesting. 

	carmen:
		regarding researching about mental illness in performance: recommend reading 'the scar of visibility' by petra kuppers. 

Classmates' Feedback:

The visual aspect helped connect to explosions in an artistic process. 

everybody grew (erika could see that everybody learned something)

Remember to provide context, so this piece WAS related to your data performance art, but you didn't state it explicitly.


REMEMBER TO PRESS RECORD when they come to you. 

	- loved the narrative of it. 

	- loved how the music moved with it. loved the context of seeing our class in it. 

	- intrigued by being able to read it

	- timing of the last image could have been viewed for much longer. 

	- how would it work if the audience had no connection to the names or project names/filenames.

	there is a way in which the final
