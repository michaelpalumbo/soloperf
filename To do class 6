october 16: informal sharings //proposed representation of the piece. 

15 minutes:

One of my critical feedback from last week was from Desiree, where she felt it was something that she could have done. (tinkering with the instrument)
	- so i want you to know that i took this to be a good thing, because the piece is about tinkering. so, for this performance I've created a synthesizer where the control structure gets scrambled at the beginning of the piece. ANNND I'm going to have Desiree perform it. 

	What to put into the piece for next time:

		- "butterfly chaos" kept coming up on the screen (the sample name for the granulation buffer )
		- really felt like the weight of having the synth be deleted / gone. 
	- potential for compelling resonance with the words on the screen. is there 
	- were the aesthetics of what we were looking at a choice? (great question because the visuals seen by the audience benefit the engineer's mind, not the audience.)
	- can the visuals have a greater intensity of poetic meaning/value? 
	- why were there green colours?
	- when you called your instrument you've never played before 
	- nobody knows this world so what can you do to allow yourself to have more creative play in what the.  
	- desiree says that she feels that you could do this. 
	- Ray felt a bit forgotten and distanced from the piece. 
	- lack of sentimentality means that it lacks the ability to connect to it meaningfully(?)
