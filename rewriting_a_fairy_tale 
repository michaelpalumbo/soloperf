when you are stuck with writing, pick a very short story, ideally something that has the right structure you are looking for, and rewrite it by placing yourself in as one of the characters or objects. i.e.: goldilocks and the three bears:

who are you in this story?

	- i am sensibly satiated goldilocks

	Once upon a time a house. At the table in the kitchen, there were three bowls of porridge. "Ahh, this porridge is just right," Sensibly Satiated Goldilocks said happily, and ran away into the forest. And she never returned home.
