Formal proposal. digital form: looking for funding. aim is to look for funding for a work-in-progress. ok i have a piece in mind, its related to these subjects, or i will be exploring this-and-that. written pitching for funding for a work in progress. no more than 300 words. Whatever we are applying to it will be different to everyone. if applying for summerworks, it will be different than OAC. Can include artistic support material to seduce who we're pitching to. Can include a max 4-minute video, or images. written material is rarely enough. we could alos write to find collaborators, or directors: this is my project, i'm looking for performers/collaborators/etc.
