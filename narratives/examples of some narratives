examples of some narratives:

rags to riches - underdog story

the quest - go and retrieve something

voyage and return - can be similar to the quest, but includes a journey that can be internal, or external. 

comedies tend to be more confusing

tragedy

rebirth -- often in all stories in some way. the character changes!

	- some key things:
		the main character needs to have some change. 
			- if they don't change, then you need to address it, because their not changing could be comedic. 

moral tale. (deprecated term. we now say '')


	- you have to say what the audience will get out of this: what do you want the people in the audience to go out for coffee after the show and sit and talk about?
