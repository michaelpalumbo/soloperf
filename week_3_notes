amanda's performance: 

I could see your face whenever you looked down at a page. 


corey: some of the texts slides moved too quickly for me to read. also, i tend to find any time someone speaks in front of text i just ignore the voice. 


Gulce:
	- dynamics in the strobe? change in rate, ratio of light to dark?
	- do you want the strobe's dynamics to to remain static throughout the piece?




at end of class: make sure you tell Amanda that you could see her face whenever you looked down at the page.
