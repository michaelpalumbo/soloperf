what is the hardest thing in your life? the thing that is bugging you the most, the biggest thing that you don't understand, and plagues you. 
	--that I say yes to something, and then shortly afterward want to run and hide from it. i then avoid the people related to this, i avoid places where i might run into them.

1. What are you healing in yourself?
	-- i am taking better care of my body -- i have decided to continually elevate my standards, to not settle. i think this is related to the hardest thing in my life, where i have what i now consider really low standards as far as what i expect of myself, and how i want myself to be seen by others. (remember erika said that courage is required for wanting to kick ass, and to be vulnerable. I believe that i am trying to do neither. )
	- for my body movement in the circle i did shrimping from bjj. i shrimped from the centre back into round. i was afraid to do a rickson situp, so i just did the shrimping. but maybe in a way the shrimping could be related to the hardest thing in my life, where i'm shrimping away from opportunities shrimping away from .... shrimping takes effort, i even feel that my hips are a little sore from the movement on the hard floor, and it feels analogous to how much work it takes to avoid people and avoiding reponsibilities. funny that my intent is to build up my physical strength, and that in one of my physical activities (bjj, which i've been afraid to go back to) shrimping is a defensive manouever

2. who is one other person that you actually know who you can talk to?
	-- someone who has the same issue. someone who gets it. 


3. what is the group(s) that are dealing with the issue? what is the group that addresses or brings together people that are struggling with that thing?


4. how does that affect everyone? 
	- i disappoint people
	- the world misses out on what beauty i have to offer

the practical about this is how do you take something that is political and make it personal, and how do you take something that is 'naval gazing' and make it about something that is political. 

what is a political thing that you'd love to change about the world?
	- that our computers, right now, are being designed to not be upgradeable. i hate this

		what is the group that addresses this issue?
			- i don't know! but i guess maybe F/OSS people?  

			who is one other person who is politically alighned who wants to fight that fight?	
				- well, Magda today expressed that she was very disappointed to find out that her laptop (touch-bar macbook pro) is not upgradeable at all. 


i don't want to hit anyone. i also am supremely self-conscious about performing with my body. i don't want to commit to moving my body in playing with someone else. i hated the 'beat up that political issue you despise' exercise, until the 3rd part, where erika asked us to have compassion for the other person, saying that they are in it for similar reasons as yourself, so the focus should be about letting the issue come out of your self, your body, release it through them. the way i found it to work was to move away from them. funny, what i was moving away from wasy Apple and other companies that make products that can't be upgraded, but its interesting that >>> i moved away in several instances of this class (moving away from responsibilities, moving away from people, shrimping away, now moving away from tech companies that devalue being able to improve one's tools)


think about your issue, and think of an absurd action that could fix your issue

what would you do to the world?
	- send a virus to all laptops that are not customizable, that forces people to have to learn how to hack their own devices in order to 'free' their devices

what would you do to the group?
	- expose Apple's hardware profiles/configs and software to open-source so that hackintoshing would be easier. 

what would you do to an individual?
	- force tim cook to use a touch-bar macbook pro 8 years from now, force him to update to latest gen os. 


	FOUNDATION OF TRUTHFULNESS
		- as an audience member you want the performer to give them something. so its important to dig into yourself and really offer something to the work.

	POWER OF REFLECTION (IN THE MEDIUM)



	the simple act of moving when doing reflection is essential. all the tools that you have, the three dimensional being that you are/have, use these to augment your reflection practice. 

	PRIVACY IS A BIG DEAL AS AN ARTIST 

	creating 'dream states or structured madness', there is often a lot of framing that needs to be done for a single jewel. you don't need to have many jewels. 


		>>> the part of you that knows how to do things is avoiding all of the good things!
