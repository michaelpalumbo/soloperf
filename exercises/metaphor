based on the character you just worked with in the 'play a character' exercise (hans moleman): jump to metaphor. focus on what your character wants. 

who(is now a what), where, when, and what do you want. 

i am a pepperoni stick, and I want to get into a a package for sale. But, not just any package. Like, I don't want to be a hotrod at a gas station. but ultimately, he has no agency, the writers just fill him in at the funniest moments. 

just wrote this in the commit message:

"hans moleman is a pepperoni stick who wants to be packaged and sold by a great company. this doesn't say anything about the source of his meat(s), or who his desired customers are"

so he doesn't care where he comes from. this was evident in the conversation with jason, where moleman couldn't remember much about his home, or even who his family is. at one point he talked about his best friend steve,as a kid, where they would drive on the highway together. later, when asked if he had a wife, he said his wife's name was steve, but the case only turned out to be that the only person in his life that he could remember was named 'steve'. 

as a pepperoni stick, he also doesn't care who his desired customers are. this was also refelected in the conversation with Jason, where he seems to always pop up out of nowhere, to be some tragic non-sequitur with the main characters in the scene. 

does not know when it is, so its entirely possible that he's past his shelf life. 


Erika says you should record yourself talking about this, and then use it as source material for a piece. You could totally sample hans moleman from the web and use that too. like "my groinnnn"
