based on the character you just worked with in the 'play a character' exercise (hans moleman): jump to metaphor. focus on what your character wants. 

who(is now a what), where, when, and what do you want. 

i am a pepperoni stick, and I want to get into a a package for sale. But, not just any package. Like, I don't want to be a hotrod at a gas station.
