Desiree:

- sometmies i would know what i was effecting, other times i wouldn't. 

- if i didn't touch anything, would the sound still move?	
	- would there still be sound changing. 
	- it doesn't necessarily need to be controlled externally. 

		- its necessry to play a guitar to make it make sound. 

how to get a break from the sound? 
	- 

can the rate of adding additional mappings be slower over the course of the piece? 

what could be written into the piece that could remove mappings?

didn't look at the mapping matrix until she found the controller constantly. 

- at first she thought that the controllers would only be mapped when they were pushed all the way to 127. 

- randomness is such a bad word, reminds her of being 14, 'that is so random'. 
	- but what makes it random is seemingly uncontrolled, in that she can't go back to control something. but it is controled, in that she can't go back and satisfy something that she wants. so it is controlled, in that she has a perceptible impact on the estate of the machine, but that this specific impact changes over time. 

sometimes she would change something but nothing would change, and that made her less precious about just going right into changing lots of other knobs. 

its continuously problem solving, but you don't know what the problem is, or the solution.


what the audience can see?	
	- interesting about the idea of cause and effect. 
		- somehow seeing the korg nano, and seeing it being controlled, and see it relating to the different mappings being added. how things are effected. 
			- can you show the patching? can you change the colour of the patch cables of the systems that are being acted on. 
				- asked a question about this in the cycling 74 forums! hopefully something will come back. 


Don't change the patch layout! don't make them aligned! desiree says it begs someone to follow it. whereas a control panel is unfamiliar. the idea of mindmapping is so familiar to us, this simple form to help us digest it. its also the opposite of random. 
	- seeing the patch takes it out of the music world, needing to know what a reverb is. you just need to know that the controller is effecting a given box(es)
