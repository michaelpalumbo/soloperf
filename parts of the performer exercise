parts of the performer exercise

your critic self - only appears before and after your performance
your producer self - tilting the piece at times: 'tilting the piece', professionally is sometimes a good thing. means its going to affect the content radically. sometimes you have to hold your guns, but other times you decide its the right thing. 

don't let your producer self interrupt your rehearsals. don't allow yourself to be texting, taking calls, working etc. during rehearsals. 

your performer needs to stay healthy and well trained. 

artist doesn't judge what is being asked to do. 

outside of your rehearsal, your artist sleeps eats and learns material. 


therapist/healer. must be ever present and catalogue or catch the things you need to process or work on (sometimes that is allowed during rehearsal)
	- don't need to process things during rehearsal. 
	- don't pretend it isn't important, it is, but also don't let it consume your rehearsal. 
	your therapist/healer gets you to the people you need to see to keep you healthy. 
	- if you are the raw material, take good care of it. treat yourself like the violin.

	really exciting that you can move away from a GUI that is designed for a technical person, and towards something that is more poetically meaningful for an audience!


	director: you need to rehearse the introduction!
