desiree felt like she was learning it. 

interesting that Elliot said she couldn't find cause and effect

makram:
	- audience relationship, and the first time he saw it. the first one was way more inclusive. he felt it was taking him places, and at some point he was worried it wouldn't, then it died, and was left with the mountains. 

	- why only digital sound, could desiree make sound too?

mark: 
	- would like a roadmap. the audience that is participating in this, the rhythms are more familiar. i'm watching something kill itself. and i'm finding it nice that there is still a human involved. 

mallory: 
	- what are these sounds, where did they get sourced from? why these sounds? what is their life beyond this. 
	-

gulce:
	- assuming it is not an auditory thing, but more of a performative thing. the first time i had a visceral reaction to something like this. 
	- if it is performative, i would prefer to see the performer. 
	- wish their was a light on desiree when she was performing
	- can't pass beyond the 'so what' part
	- when i was playing it last week, it was more listenable 

carmen: 
	- what is the story?
		- where is the personal. where do i get to experience you?
		- why does it matter if desiree plays it?

amanda:
	- i would like to see if somehow you can hook up some controls to someone's body. have gulce move her body, and have it affect. 

rae: thought it was cool how desiree was playing it. you became a storyteller. there was also darkness, so it would have been cool if there was a light on you. 

=== erika:
	- the visuals were so much more exciting, so that is a great step forward. 
	- i wish we could read what was in the boxes. if there was some kind of meaningful associations that were coming from you. that would mean that someone could play you. need some associations related to you. the duration of it becomes questionable because it doesn't have a throughline that develops. 
		- the whole notion of composition in time. the fascination with the visuals wears out. i think you can make it more compelling in time. something to hook us in. 
		- dramaturgical structure. how does it progress. it plateaued very quickly for me-- entertained me with the visuals and the and visuals, but after not long it got tired. 
		- we need access to something human in order to sit there long enough -- what are the human elements in this? what are you as the artist communicating to me, that meets me sense of humanity, or challenges my sense of community, but i need to know WHY.
		- i think you need to be way braver. make it compositionally compelling.
