Kelly

goal is to have a 45 minute show about her childhood, but not have herself physically in the show. 

-- as an exercise (?) are there ways to have the audience know that a character is talking to you without addressing you by name?

Erika: There's always a desire to want to figure out right away what order fragments go in. Don't force this. have random orders. be ok with it. 
		erika:

		risk
		do we care
		is it compelling
		is the research good (also where are you at in the research process)

I asked: why is it important to state how long the piece will be this early in your process?

Carmen

have you read ernest becker's "The Denial of Death"?

	- that you are concerned with being afraid of not having control. Becker: we are gods with anuses. 

her character 'Pencil Lady' keeps talking about the 'death of a generation'
	- figure eight could also be a mobius strip. Hoffstadter's writing on the incompleteness theorem. (I am a strange loop )

	- on know when you will die, watch the film, "the brand new testament"


	- "when you are scared of dying you don't really live."

Shalon

- the amount of humour already embedded in the piece, like your face, your movements, very clear you want us in on some kind of joke. But when your character spoke, there is something about that accent that has been so established as a trope that, combined with the other humour was too much.
