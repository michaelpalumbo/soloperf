Kelly

goal is to have a 45 minute show about her childhood, but not have herself physically in the show. 

-- as an exercise (?) are there ways to have the audience know that a character is talking to you without addressing you by name?

Erika: There's always a desire to want to figure out right away what order fragments go in. Don't force this. have random orders. be ok with it. 
		erika:

		risk
		do we care
		is it compelling
		is the research good (also where are you at in the research process)

I asked: why is it important to state how long the piece will be this early in your process?
