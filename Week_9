Showings:


Carmen
- the last line, revealing what the lipstick said .. didn't care for it

Amanda
- moment near the end when isabella was trying to find her parents, there was a long beat, and the cold sound of a distant airplane could be heard 

Shalon
- i was surprised by how long the chain was.

Rae
- when you moved the lamp from the back of the screen to the front, for about 5 seconds you pointed directly at the audience. I suppose i had been focusing intently on the screen to make out the lettering, that the lamp shone directly in my eyes was painful. 


Mark
- i notice you are in dialogue with yourself whenever you present.  i was more interested in how you kept going in and out of your character increasingly as the kettle wasn't boiling, 

Gulce
- 

desiree
- using the box as a resonator was really cool (i know you must have also jacked the audio up quite a bit)


Jason

feedback:

Jason enjoyed the parts when the silence 

there was an effect where the light from the outside was reflecting on the tree leaves, and these changing patterns were being 'drawn' on the wall opposite the windows. just so happened that since i turned the lights off and asked them to do an embodied listening, they found the tree patterns changing beautifully with the music, apparently was trippy. 

Erika's rubrik:
	- execution
		- Did the paint hit the wall, but not did it make a good painting. 
	- effort
	- originality and creativity

It's helpful to contextualize. Get up and say "this will be in a really big theatre". You are often showing work in less-than-deail situations. 

why do you need us? you have to have a secret need for the audience, the SPECIFIC AUDIENCE IN FRONT OF YOU to be there.
