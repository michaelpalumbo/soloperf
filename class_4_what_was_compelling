what was compelling

-- stakes seemed really high for everyone. 

-- perform less. trust yourself more. 

throwing shit at the wall does not mean that you have to perform using a skill you are familiar with. 

it doesn't take as long as you think to just take a breath and work into the piece. 


connection relationship and skill


you have to believe that audience knows as much or more than you do. 

the risk is in having a point of view.


look for the questions that you don't have answers to. 


highlights from the presentations:
	- "butterfly chaos" kept coming up on the screen (the sample name for the granulation buffer )
		- really felt like the weight of having the synth be deleted / gone.
