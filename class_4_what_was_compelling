what was compelling

-- stakes seemed really high for everyone. 

-- perform less. trust yourself more. 

throwing shit at the wall does not mean that you have to perform using a skill you are familiar with. 

it doesn't take as long as you think to just take a breath and work into the piece. 


connection relationship and skill


you have to believe that audience knows as much or more than you do. 

the risk is in having a point of view.


look for the questions that you don't have answers to. 


highlights from the presentations:
	- "butterfly chaos" kept coming up on the screen (the sample name for the granulation buffer )
		- really felt like the weight of having the synth be deleted / gone. 
	- potential for compelling resonance with the words on the screen. is there 
	- were the aesthetics of what we were looking at a choice? (great question because the visuals seen by the audience benefit the engineer's mind, not the audience.)
	- can the visuals have a greater intensity of poetic meaning/value? 
	- why were there green colours?
	- when you called your instrument you've never played before 
	- nobody knows this world so what can you do to allow yourself to have more creative play in what the.  
	- desiree says that she feels that you could do this. 
	- Ray felt a bit forgotten and distanced from the piece. 
	- lack of sentimentality means that it lacks the ability to connect to it meaningfully(?)

Erika said to Desiree that you don't have to be the performer of your piece. And Desiree did say that she felt she could do it (which is interesting in itself, that tinkering is the whole point). -- so, could you write an instrument for her, and have it randomize the control stucture for each time?
