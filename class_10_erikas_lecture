My question about All of this: I can see ways to use this in composition, but i don't have training in myself as a performer. 


On crafting narrative from a work. (not that your piece has to have narrative, but you have to be able to talk about it as a narrative or else people will think you don't know what you're doing.)

Also Erika says that when she means Narrative, she's really thinking about how you're organizing the piece in TIME. How have you organized time FOR THE AUDIENCE. 

the thing about the hero's journey: people who are watching netflix and movies, they are addicted to that one thing. 


		WHY DO WE CARE?
		 	- let's talk about why we care. 

Spalding Gray: its as if he knows your (audience member) name. He is sincere in his delivery that cares about the audience that he looks to. He NEEDED HIS AUDIENCE. 
	BUT he is a very audience-interactive performer; how do you convey NEEDING YOUR AUDIENCE if you aren't into interactivity?

	Spalding Gray's rhythm is changing in subtle ways. He doesn't have a constant rhythm, but its there, the rhythm changes subtly. 

	The classic clown trope: we see the performer trying to achieve something, and if they are well-trained enough they will be able to convince the audience that they just can't get something, whatever it is. (Erika played around 'trying' to reach his foot?)

Shakespearean restoration seduction/power: i.e. Kevin Spacey's Frank Underwood character. 


		WHY DO WE CARE?
			- "I will love you if you love me"

			- Sometimes we care if the character is in great pain.

			- you should constantly be looking for 'why do we care, why do we care, why do we care', and trying to find ways of hooking people in at each of the places. don't assume that because you care others will too. 

Be familiar with what the current storytelling structures are.
